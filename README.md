## Datasets used for module 2 onwards
From module 2 onwards, I've accessed the data of various other stocks, index and commodities.The links for the same have been provided in this section
## 1. Stocks
### Small Cap

A mid-cap company is a company with `Mid market capitalization` above Rs.5000 crores and less than Rs.20000 crores . As the name implies, a mid-cap company falls in the middle of the pack between large-cap and small-cap companies, considered to be a safer investment than small cap companies at the cost larger possible gains.
